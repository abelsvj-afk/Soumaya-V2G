# Gemini Changes Tracker

This document tracks all changes made by Gemini to the Soumaya Brain repository. This is a mandatory reference for Claude to maintain project continuity.

## Completed Tasks

### 2026-06-16: Infrastructure & Assets
- **Git Installation**: Installed `git` via `apk`.
- **Spacecraft Implementation**:
    - Restored the original `soumaya-ship.glb` for the maintenance agent.
    - Added `space_station_3.glb` as a new orbiting entity in the 3D scene (with a procedural fallback if the model fails).
    - Created `packages/web/src/graph/spaceStation.ts` for station logic.
    - Updated `packages/web/src/graph/Graph3D.tsx` to include the station.
    - **Propulsion Physics**: Implemented dynamic engine glow scaling in `packages/web/src/graph/soumaya.ts` based on velocity.

### 2026-06-16: Soumaya Agent & Command Center
- **Agent Renaming**: Completely renamed the maintenance agent from "Samaya" to "Soumaya" across the entire codebase.
- **Background Evolution**: 
    - Refactored maintenance logic into a standalone `MaintenanceService`.
    - Implemented a server-side "Soumaya Heartbeat" in `packages/server/src/index.ts` that performs autonomous maintenance every 5 minutes.
- **Soft-Delete Safety**:
    - Added `deleted_at` and `merged_into` columns to the `nodes` table.
    - Updated `NodesRepo` to support soft-deletion, preserving memory history during fusions.
    - Graph queries now automatically filter out "tombstone" nodes.
- **Multi-Stop Navigation**:
    - Upgraded `packages/web/src/graph/soumaya.ts` to support sequential flight paths.
    - The Soumaya ship now visits all targets in a job (e.g., both nodes in a fusion) before completion.
- **Command Center UI**: 
    - Added `packages/web/src/components/SoumayaPanel.tsx`.
    - Made the Soumaya ship clickable in the 3D scene to open the panel.
    - Added a live activity log of all autonomous actions.
    - Added a toggle for the token-consuming "Research Mode".
- **Maintenance Backend**:
    - Registered `maintenanceRoutes` in `server.ts` with ESM compatibility.
    - Created SQLite tables: `agent_logs`, `settings`, and `daily_logs`.
    - Implemented diverse job types: Synthesis, Calibration, Patrol, Pruning, Harmonization, Research, and Merging.
- **Strategic Hub Research**:
    - Restricted research only to established hubs (Degree > 1, Importance >= 0.4).
    - Research findings are injected back into the original node, increasing its importance and causing visual celestial growth.
- **Memory Fusion (Merging)**:
    - Soumaya detects near-identical memories (similarity > 0.96) and fuses them using the LLM.
    - Edges are re-routed to the surviving hub, and the redundant node is deleted.
- **Job-Specific Animations**:
    - Upgraded `packages/web/src/graph/effects.ts` with unique burst pools.
    - Synthesis (Cyan/Blue beam), Harmonization (Gold pulses), Pruning (Red fractures), Calibration (Indigo ripples), and Merging (Dark Purple Vortex implosion).

### 2026-06-16: Cosmic Personality Upgrades
- **Celestial Titling (Star-Namer)**: LLM autonomously generates poetic names for new memories (stored in `celestialTitle`).
- **Emotional Gravity Ripples**: LLM assigns a hex `color` based on the memory's vibe, directly influencing the 3D body's render color.
- **Dream Synthesis**: Rewrote the Synthesis prompt to act as a "Dream Interpreter," creating cryptic, profound connections.
- **Atmospheric Sector Summaries**: Soumaya autonomously charts "Sector Vibes" for memory clusters (appended to the center hub).
- **Captain's Log**: Soumaya autonomously generates a daily summary of new memories and her maintenance actions, displayed in the Command Center.

## Pending Tasks (User requested to "forget it" for now)
- [ ] Fix UI layout overlaps in the bottom menu/list content.
- [ ] Fix "Add thought" button overlap with other buttons.
- [ ] Fix volume/focus/list button blocking text.
