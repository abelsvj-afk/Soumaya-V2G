# CLAUDE.md

**MANDATORY**: Refer to [GEMINI_CHANGES.md](./GEMINI_CHANGES.md) for all modifications and [SOUMAYA_ROADMAP.md](./SOUMAYA_ROADMAP.md) for system gaps and planned evolution.

**CRITICAL**: Claude (Lead Engineer) must rigorously review all Gemini-implemented code for potential pitfalls, architectural inconsistencies, or sub-optimal patterns. Gemini's contributions are intended as rapid prototyping/assistance and require senior-level validation before being considered final.

Guidance for working in this repo. Read this before making changes.

## What this is

**Soumaya · Second Brain** — a personal knowledge graph you talk to. You dump raw
thoughts; the system extracts typed nodes + relationships, embeds them, links them
associatively, and renders them as a navigable 3D **galaxy** where memories are
celestial bodies with real gravitational mass.

Signature features: **associative auto-linking**, **synthesis digest** (surfaces
latent connections), **chat-with-your-brain** (GraphRAG with cited answers), and
the **celestial galaxy UI**.

## Monorepo layout (npm workspaces)

- `packages/shared` — domain types + zod schemas + celestial mechanics. The single
  source of truth shared by server and web. Changes here ripple both ways.
- `packages/server` — Express API, SQLite + sqlite-vec, ingestion pipeline, LLM
  providers, graph/synthesis/chat services. Runs TypeScript directly via `tsx`.
- `packages/web` — Vite + React + react-force-graph-3d (three.js) galaxy client.

## Commands

```bash
npm test            # all vitest suites (server). Keep green.
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit across workspaces. Keep clean.
npm run build       # builds the web app
npm run dev         # local dev (server + web)
```

Always run `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` before committing. The web app must
`npm run build -w @brain/web` cleanly.

## Architecture conventions

- **Provider seams.** Embeddings (`embeddings/adapter.ts`) and LLM
  (`llm/adapter.ts`) are interfaces with swappable implementations. There is
  always a no-API-key fallback: `hash` embeddings and the `heuristic` LLM, so the
  app is fully functional offline. Never make a feature hard-depend on a cloud key.
- **Repositories** (`repositories/*.repo.ts`) own all SQL for an entity. Services
  compose repos; routes are thin and only validate + delegate.
- **Vectors** live in the `vec_nodes` vec0 table (`db/vec.ts`), joined on node id.
  Relational schema is in `db/schema.ts`; raw bootstrap + additive migrations are
  in `db/client.ts` (`migrateSchema` — use it for new columns so existing Fly
  volumes upgrade in place).
- **zod schemas** in `shared/schema.ts` are reused as Gemini `responseSchema` —
  keep them flat (deep schemas are fragile with the API).

## Celestial mass model (the galaxy physics)

`shared/celestial.ts` is the heart of the visual system:

- Each memory has an **importance** (0..1, rated by the LLM at ingestion; the
  heuristic provider scores it from weighty vocabulary + length).
- `deriveMass({ importance, degree, emotionalWeight })` blends significance,
  connectedness, and emotional charge into a **0..1 mass**.
- `classify(mass)` → `star | planet | moon`.
- The **graph service enriches nodes on read** with `degree`, `mass`, `val`, and
  `celestial` — never denormalize these into the table.
- Frontend: `forces.ts` applies N-body gravity (heavy bodies pull light ones in),
  bodies render per class with pulsing emissive + coronas, links are particle
  "space dust". The simulation never fully cools (`d3AlphaDecay(0)` +
  `cooldownTicks=Infinity`) so the galaxy keeps drifting.

When adding signals that should affect gravity, fold them into `deriveMass` so
both rendering and physics stay consistent.

## Guardrails / middleware (server)

- `api/middleware.ts`: `securityHeaders` (nosniff / DENY framing / no-referrer)
  and a dependency-free in-memory `rateLimit` on `/api` (`RATE_LIMIT_MAX`, default
  120/min). `trust proxy` is set for correct client IPs behind Fly.
- `express.json({ limit: "1mb" })` caps body size.
- Every route validates its body with zod and returns 400 on bad input.
- Central error handler in `api/server.ts` catches async rejections (Express 5).
- Keep new routes to this pattern: validate → delegate to a service → json.

## Deployment

Single container (Fly.io): `Dockerfile` builds the web app, bakes the MiniLM
embedding model into the image, and the Express server serves both the API and the
static web (`WEB_DIR`). SQLite persists on a Fly volume at `/data`. CI in
`.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml` tests then deploys (needs `FLY_API_TOKEN`).

LLM is optional — without a key the app runs in heuristic mode. To use a key:
`fly secrets set LLM_PROVIDER=gemini GEMINI_API_KEY=...` or
`fly secrets set LLM_PROVIDER=openai OPENAI_API_KEY=...` (defaults to the cheap
`gpt-4o-mini`; override with `OPENAI_MODEL`). Cloud providers degrade to the
heuristic automatically on credit/quota errors (see ResilientLlmProvider).

## House rules

- Match the surrounding code's style and comment density (comments explain *why*).
- Don't add dependencies casually — prefer small, dependency-free solutions.
- Don't break the offline fallback path.
- Don't put model identifiers or secrets in committed files.
