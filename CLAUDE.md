# CLAUDE.md

**MANDATORY — development process.** All substantive work follows the full
[`docs/AI_ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW.md`](./docs/AI_ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW.md) lifecycle —
**Rule #1: no code is written until the design/spec is complete.** ([`WORKFLOW.md`](./WORKFLOW.md)
is the lighter day-to-day loop derived from it.) This is standing policy; it does not need to be
re-stated each session.

**MANDATORY — post-MVP workflow.** [`docs/AI_ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW_POST_MVP.md`](./docs/AI_ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW_POST_MVP.md)
governs all work **once the current tools/functions build-out is complete** (Soumaya's tool-router
fleet + the neuro-aligned features). At that cutover it becomes the operating workflow: MVP Freeze →
repository/bug/quality/debt/dependency audits → architecture/refactor/security/testing/performance/
observability → AI validation (memory, prompts, retrieval, hallucination, cost) → product readiness
(UX, a11y, docs sync, beta, deployment, rollback, monitoring). Until the cutover, keep shipping under
the lighter loop above; do not prematurely freeze features.

**STATUS (2026-07-10): first post-MVP hardening cycle COMPLETE; freeze LIFTED.** All the phases above
ran once and shipped (see `docs/POST_MVP_AUDIT.md`, `POST_MVP_PHASE4/5/9/12*.md`). We are back in
**feature-growth mode** under the lighter loop, steered by the north-star docs below. Re-freeze and
re-run the post-MVP phases before the *next* major expansion — not per feature. Part 6 (Continuous
Ops: repo-health/KPIs/governance) is the standing rhythm going forward.

**MANDATORY — product north star.** We are building Soumaya toward the patterns in
[`docs/SECOND_BRAIN_BRIEFING.md`](./docs/SECOND_BRAIN_BRIEFING.md) (Obsidian "second brain"
adaptation; the research calls us "Sarmiah" — same product). The live gap analysis + staged growth
plan is [`docs/SECOND_BRAIN_ALIGNMENT.md`](./docs/SECOND_BRAIN_ALIGNMENT.md) — consult it when
planning new feature growth. The neuroscience cross-reference (what to build vs. skip, evidence-
graded) is [`docs/NEURO_ALIGNMENT.md`](./docs/NEURO_ALIGNMENT.md). **Core principle from it:
memory is made by *retrieval*, not storage** — the galaxy is the memory palace, but a spaced-
repetition + gentle active-recall layer (dimming stars = review cue; Soumaya nudges recall in her
own voice, never Anki decks) is the highest-leverage growth direction and a first-class staged feature.

**MANDATORY — Vision 2.0 (Journeys).** [`docs/VISION_2_JOURNEYS.md`](./docs/VISION_2_JOURNEYS.md) is the
user-authored, version-controlled **source of truth** for Soumaya's next era: everything ultimately
belongs to a **Journey** (a meaningful life chapter), Soumaya asks *"what Journey does this help?"*
instead of "where do I save this?", the daily loop lands in **Mission Control**, the galaxy is a
**Living Galaxy** that reflects life in motion, and money/tasks/memories/people all connect through
Journeys. **Consider every new feature against this doc — where it can serve a Journey, it should.**
Large pieces get their own spec first (per the workflow), but this governs *what* we build toward.

**MANDATORY — read before proposing new feature growth.** [`HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md`](./HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md)
is a dated, honest outside read on whether this product is actually worth using long-term (not a
status log — a frozen verdict, re-run periodically, entries appended not overwritten).
[`docs/OPTIMIZATION_ROADMAP.md`](./docs/OPTIMIZATION_ROADMAP.md) is the non-destructive fix plan for
what it found — **no tab removal, no rebuild; fix/consolidate/surface what's already built.** Weigh
any new feature idea against closing the roadmap's open problems before adding more surface area.

**MANDATORY**: Refer to [GEMINI_CHANGES.md](./GEMINI_CHANGES.md) for all modifications, asset additions, and infrastructure changes made by the second agent (Antigravity CLI / `agy`), to ensure continuity between agents. The second agent's own mandates + green/red zones live in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) (the file `agy` auto-loads).

Guidance for working in this repo. Read this before making changes.

## What this is

**Soumaya · Second Brain** — a personal knowledge graph you talk to. You dump raw
thoughts; the system extracts typed nodes + relationships, embeds them, links them
associatively, and renders them as a navigable 3D **galaxy** where memories are
celestial bodies with real gravitational mass.

Signature features: **associative auto-linking**, **synthesis digest** (surfaces
latent connections), **chat-with-your-brain** (GraphRAG with cited answers), and
the **celestial galaxy UI**.

## Monorepo layout (npm workspaces)

- `packages/shared` — domain types + zod schemas + celestial mechanics. The single
  source of truth shared by server and web. Changes here ripple both ways.
- `packages/server` — Express API, SQLite + sqlite-vec, ingestion pipeline, LLM
  providers, graph/synthesis/chat services. Runs TypeScript directly via `tsx`.
- `packages/web` — Vite + React + react-force-graph-3d (three.js) galaxy client.

## Commands

```bash
npm test            # all vitest suites (server). Keep green.
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit across workspaces. Keep clean.
npm run build       # builds the web app
npm run dev         # local dev (server + web)
```

Always run `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` before committing. The web app must
`npm run build -w @brain/web` cleanly.

## Architecture conventions

- **Provider seams.** Embeddings (`embeddings/adapter.ts`) and LLM
  (`llm/adapter.ts`) are interfaces with swappable implementations. There is
  always a no-API-key fallback: `hash` embeddings and the `heuristic` LLM, so the
  app is fully functional offline. Never make a feature hard-depend on a cloud key.
- **Repositories** (`repositories/*.repo.ts`) own all SQL for an entity. Services
  compose repos; routes are thin and only validate + delegate.
- **Vectors** live in the `vec_nodes` vec0 table (`db/vec.ts`), joined on node id.
  Relational schema is in `db/schema.ts`; raw bootstrap + additive migrations are
  in `db/client.ts` (`migrateSchema` — use it for new columns so existing Fly
  volumes upgrade in place).
- **zod schemas** in `shared/schema.ts` are reused as Gemini `responseSchema` —
  keep them flat (deep schemas are fragile with the API).

## Celestial mass model (the galaxy physics)

`shared/celestial.ts` is the heart of the visual system:

- Each memory has an **importance** (0..1, rated by the LLM at ingestion; the
  heuristic provider scores it from weighty vocabulary + length).
- `deriveMass({ importance, degree, emotionalWeight })` blends significance,
  connectedness, and emotional charge into a **0..1 mass**.
- `classify(mass)` → 6 tiers: `asteroid | moon | planet | giant | star | supergiant`.
- The **graph service enriches nodes on read** with `degree`, `mass`, `val`, and
  `celestial` — never denormalize these into the table.
- Frontend motion is **kinematic** (`graph/orbits.ts`), not a force sim: each body
  orbits its heaviest connected neighbor on a fixed path (pinned via fx/fy/fz), so
  it never collapses. `orbits.getDescendants(id)` powers the "isolate system" view.
- Agents/assets (`graph/soumaya.ts` ship, `graph/spaceStation.ts`) are glTF models
  in `packages/web/public/*.glb` with procedural fallbacks; the autonomous agent
  loop hits `/api/maintenance/*` and is **token-gated behind Research Mode**.

When adding signals that should affect gravity, fold them into `deriveMass` so
both rendering and physics stay consistent.

## Multi-tenancy (private brains)

One deployment hosts many private "spaces" (brains). Every per-user table
(`nodes`, `edges`, `insights`, `agent_logs`, `daily_logs`) carries a `space_id`;
`settings` stays global (the shared deployment API budget). Auth is a lightweight
name + passcode (`auth/spaces.ts`, scrypt-hashed) — the returned random space id
is the client's bearer key, stored in localStorage and sent as the `x-space-id`
header. `requireSpace` (api/middleware.ts) validates it and stashes it on
`res.locals`; routes read it via `spaceOf(res)` and pass it to **space-scoped
repositories** (`new NodesRepo(handle, spaceId)`) and helpers — every repo/service
takes a `spaceId` defaulting to `DEFAULT_SPACE` ("legacy") so internal/test callers
still work. `knn(..., spaceId)` over-fetches then filters by space so vector search
never crosses brains. Pre-existing data lives under `legacy` and is claimed by the
**first** account to register. When adding a data table or query, scope it by
`space_id` the same way.

## Guardrails / middleware (server)

- `api/middleware.ts`: `securityHeaders` (nosniff / DENY framing / no-referrer)
  and a dependency-free in-memory `rateLimit` on `/api` (`RATE_LIMIT_MAX`, default
  120/min). `trust proxy` is set for correct client IPs behind Fly.
- `express.json({ limit: "1mb" })` caps body size.
- Every route validates its body with zod and returns 400 on bad input.
- Central error handler in `api/server.ts` catches async rejections (Express 5).
- Keep new routes to this pattern: validate → delegate to a service → json.

## Deployment

Single container (Fly.io): `Dockerfile` builds the web app, bakes the MiniLM
embedding model into the image, and the Express server serves both the API and the
static web (`WEB_DIR`). SQLite persists on a Fly volume at `/data`.

**How deploys actually happen (verified 2026-06-20):** GitHub Actions is **blocked on
this account** — runs `startup_failure` with 0 jobs (private-repo Actions minutes/
runner unavailable), so `.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml` never ships anything. The
working path is a **manual `fly deploy --remote-only`** (run by `agy` from Termux, who
has the `FLY_API_TOKEN`; this sandbox has no flyctl/Fly network). The durable fix is to
reconnect **Fly's native GitHub auto-deploy** (Fly dashboard → app → GitHub), which
builds the Dockerfile on push without Actions. Either way: pushing alone does NOT deploy
right now — trigger a `fly deploy` (delegate to `agy`) after pushing branch changes you
want live. Migrations must be additive + idempotent so a deploy can never crash boot on
the existing volume (`migrateSchema`; covered by `migration.test.ts`).

LLM is optional — without a key the app runs in heuristic mode. To use a key:
`fly secrets set LLM_PROVIDER=gemini GEMINI_API_KEY=...` or
`fly secrets set LLM_PROVIDER=openai OPENAI_API_KEY=...` (defaults to the cheap
`gpt-4o-mini`; override with `OPENAI_MODEL`). Cloud providers degrade to the
heuristic automatically on credit/quota errors (see ResilientLlmProvider).

## Agent delegation (Claude ⇄ Antigravity CLI) — spend Claude's tokens wisely

There are two coding agents on this repo and **both have GitHub access**. Claude is the
architect/lead and the only one who signs off "Verified". The second agent is
**Antigravity CLI (`agy`)** — a Go-based, headless, low-memory terminal agent (runs well
on the user's **Termux/mobile** setup) with **async parallel subagents**, a **built-in
browser subagent** (headless Chrome over MCP) for real visual QA, research/doc-conversion
slash commands, and an **MCP bridge built to let Claude delegate heavy work to it** (with
model routing + session continuity + output truncation, so it does NOT eat Claude's
context). Its full rules are in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) (the file `agy` auto-loads).

**Core principle: don't burn Claude's tokens/context on anything that is green-zone for
`agy`.** If a task is mechanical, parallelizable, evidence-gathering, or file-dump-heavy,
delegate it and consume only the conclusion.

**Delegate to `agy` (default to this):**
- Bulk/mechanical, well-specified edits — rename a thing everywhere, apply one pattern
  across many `components/*` or `graph/*` files, batch asset/CSS work.
- **Browser-based visual QA** — load the app, click through the galaxy, screenshot, record
  a `.webm` walkthrough, run a UX/design review. ⚠️ **NOT available on the user's Termux
  (android-arm64 has no compatible headless Chrome — confirmed 2026-06-21, issue #10).** From
  this hosted sandbox you also can't reach the live site. So live pixel verification falls to the
  USER (or a desktop browser); for everything else, verify behavior by headless
  reproduction/measurement (see "Verify before you build"), not by eyeballing.
- **Research & doc ingestion** — web research with citations; URL/PDF/docx/image → Markdown.
- **Broad codebase exploration** that would otherwise dump many files into Claude's context.
- Long-running **gate/build** runs and routine git ops, especially from mobile.

**How to delegate:** (a) the **MCP bridge** — call `agy` as an MCP server (preferred; it
truncates output to protect Claude's context); or (b) **GitHub** — write a crisp,
self-contained issue/PR task and let `agy` pick it up, push to the deploy branch, and
report back. Always give it a tight spec + the gate + "stage, don't push, if you hit the
Red Zone."

**MCP bridge config:** the `agy-bridge` server is committed at repo root in
[`.mcp.json`](./.mcp.json) (runs `npx -y agy-bridge`), so any Claude Code session in this
repo can delegate to `agy`. It only works where `agy` itself is installed + authenticated
(e.g. the user's Termux/laptop) — in a stripped remote sandbox the bridge is inert, so fall
back to the GitHub hand-off there. Approve the server once when Claude Code prompts to trust
project MCP servers.

**Keep for Claude (do NOT delegate):** Red-Zone work — `packages/shared/*` types/zod,
`db/*` schema + migrations, `graph/orbits.ts`, `web/src/api/client.ts`, the token/USD/Fuel
guards, `space_id` multi-tenancy scoping, route contracts — plus architecture decisions,
ambiguous/underspecified features, security/data-integrity, and the **final audit +
"Verified by Claude" checkmark**. Review `agy`'s pushes before ticking that box.

Both agents share the **same gate**, the **same deploy branch**
(`claude/soumaya-second-brain-v1-m4z4hc`), and the **same change log** (`GEMINI_CHANGES.md`).

## Verify before you build (and before you claim it works)

The gate (`typecheck && test && build`) proves code *compiles*, not that it *behaves*. Two
standards, learned the hard way (shipping "the code should spread the bodies" fixes that didn't):

1. **Prove behavior by reproduction/measurement, not assertion.** Before changing logic — especially
   visual/spatial/numeric code you can't see rendered from here (`graph/orbits.ts`, `shared/celestial.ts`,
   layout/mass math) — first *reproduce and measure* it: `npx tsx` a throwaway script that feeds real or
   synthetic data through the actual functions and prints the numbers (e.g. run `makeOrbitSystem` over
   `makeDemoGalaxy` + a single-cluster graph and assert min nearest-neighbour distance / 0 overlaps), or
   add a unit test. Decide the fix from the measured output, not from reading the code. State the
   measurement in your summary.
2. **Rule out delivery (stale deploy / PWA service-worker / cache) before re-editing correct code.** When
   "it didn't change," first confirm the new build is what's actually rendering (Actions is blocked → a
   `fly deploy` must run; the service worker can serve old cached JS even on a fresh server). Never "fix"
   code that measurement shows is already correct to chase a deploy/cache problem.

## Pending Validation

- **Soumaya Overworld Stage 1 (2026-09-11), NEW, additive, not yet on-device confirmed** — a 2D
  Pokémon-GBA-style overworld replacing the 3D galaxy per the design package in
  `docs/overworld/` (full replacement is the end state; staged so the galaxy stays intact until
  parity is proven — see `docs/overworld/decisions.md` D1). Only reachable via an explicit
  `?overworld=1` URL flag (`main.tsx`); the default app path is unaffected. Stage 1 ships a real
  Phaser 3 world: grid movement/collision/camera-follow, the Money/Bank region wired to real
  `getGraph()`/finance API data, the capture flow, and the dimming/greet-to-revisit loop wired to
  the real `entropy`/`tendNode()` mechanism (no new backend needed — see `docs/overworld/README.md`
  for why). All pure logic (movement, collision, placement determinism, the dim-state threshold,
  region layout) is unit-tested and green; the actual rendered Phaser canvas — movement feel,
  camera follow, visual layout, whether the capture/greet/bank overlays look right — has **not**
  been seen in a real browser from this sandbox and needs on-device/browser confirmation once a
  deploy is possible, same as every other item in this section.

- **Fix: Cinematic Intro Trigger** (Graph3D.tsx): Relaxed the intro trigger condition.
- **Fix: Cinematic Startup Race Condition** (Graph3D.tsx): Added `cinematicStartedRef` to prevent redundant triggers.
- **Fix: GalaxyViews Visibility** (App.tsx): Removed the `!!selected` constraint so Views remain accessible during node selection.
- **Optimization: Performance Audit & Improvements** (various): Ongoing performance work.
- **Fix: Visibility and Loading Issues** (various).
- **Optimization: Link LOD** (Graph3D.tsx): LOD optimization for dense brains.
- **Refactor: Intro and Observatory Timing** (various): Timing adjustments for smooth entrance.
- **Refactor: Startup Flow** (various): Decoupled loading dismissal from intro sequence.
- **Observatory card squish — CONFIRMED via real on-device screenshot (2026-09-03), FIXED**
  (index.css `.obs-card`): with an active user's ~15-card-deep Observatory, cards were being
  compressed below their content height (text cut off mid-sentence) instead of the already-scrollable
  `.obs-stack` actually scrolling past them — root cause was `.obs-stack`'s `overflow-y:auto` on a
  flex column resetting its children's automatic min-size to 0, so default `flex-shrink:1` let
  `.obs-card` shrink. Fixed with `flex-shrink:0` on `.obs-card` — cards now always render at full
  content height; the stack scrolls. Needs on-device re-confirmation once a deploy is possible.
- **Views toggle overlapping the left FAB column — CONFIRMED via real on-device screenshot
  (2026-09-03), FIXED** (index.css `.gv-wrap`/`.gv-chips`, `.lens-chips`): `.gv-wrap` (bottom:196px)
  sat squarely inside `.focus-cluster`'s footprint (bottom:186px, 44px tall) after that control's
  position had drifted without `.gv-wrap` being re-checked — same root-cause shape as the original
  "Fix Views button overlap" item, regressed by an unrelated later change. Moved `.gv-wrap` to
  bottom:300px, clearing the ENTIRE left FAB column (which stacks continuously 18-288px) rather than
  threading a specific gap that can silently close again. `.lens-chips` (the pinned-lens "Linked to
  X" pills) had the same problem from the opposite direction — centered and wide enough to reach
  into both the left AND right FAB columns at bottom:20px — moved to bottom:350px, above `.gv-wrap`'s
  collapsed toggle. Also capped `.gv-chips`' expanded height (`max-height:40vh; overflow-y:auto`) so
  it can't grow unboundedly. Known residual, not fully solved: if Views is expanded to several rows
  of chips AND 2+ lenses are pinned at the same time, `.gv-wrap`'s expansion could still reach up
  into `.lens-chips`' band — flagged rather than fixed with a bigger state-lifting change, since it
  wasn't the confirmed default-state bug. Needs on-device re-confirmation once a deploy is possible.
- **Observatory 🔍 search button** (Observatory.tsx header): new, added blind — confirm it doesn't
  visually collide with the existing × close button on narrow phone widths.
- **Mind tab "✓ Achieved" badge + "💾 Save as Lens" chip** (MindPanel.tsx, GalaxyViews.tsx): new,
  small pill-shaped UI elements, added blind — confirm they read clearly at a glance and don't
  crowd their row on a narrow phone.
- **Working-memory mote color-by-source + settle animation** (MindPanel.tsx, MindSpace.tsx): motes
  now tint by why the thought surfaced (manual/chat/goal/priority/emotion) instead of one flat
  blue, and a thought promoted to a real memory (via ★ or the 3rd "Keep") gets a brief flare/shrink
  in the in-panel list before it clears. Added blind — confirm the five source colors read as
  distinct at mote size (8px dot) and that the settle flourish doesn't feel like a glitch. Note:
  deliberately NOT mirrored to the ambient MindSpace overlay (it's always hidden at the exact
  moment a promotion can fire, since promoting only happens from a button inside the open Mind
  panel) — MindSpace only picked up the color tinting, which is worth an eyes-on for legibility too.
- **Link-line flicker regression — CONFIRMED via real on-device use (2026-09-03), FIXED**
  (Graph3D.tsx `shouldRenderLink`): a *different* code path than the one already fixed for this
  exact symptom (`linkVisibility`'s `linkLodZoomedInRef`, June). A later perf pass added
  `shouldRenderLink` (link-color/width short-circuit for distant/inactive links) with a bare
  `dist < 800` check re-evaluated every frame — hovering near that distance flipped every
  non-lit, low-activity link on/off every frame, reproducing at any zoom/angle whenever a node
  was selected. Fixed with the same hysteresis pattern as the original fix (an 80-unit band,
  `shouldRenderLinkCloseRef`) — the lesson (missed once already) is that this specific bug class
  needs the fix applied to every place a camera-distance check gates link visibility, not just
  the first one found. Needs on-device re-confirmation once a deploy is possible.
- **Planets not lit by the sun — CONFIRMED via real on-device use (2026-09-03), FIXED**
  (shaders.ts `makePlanetMaterial`, Graph3D.tsx tick loop): a genuine regression from the earlier
  Stage 4 "shader diet" work — planet bodies render with a custom `ShaderMaterial` that has no
  `lights: true` and never receives three.js's real light uniforms (deliberate, to avoid the
  shader-recompile cost of real per-light integration), but its fragment shader also hardcoded a
  fake light direction fixed relative to the CAMERA (`vec3(0.6,0.7,0.5)` in view space) instead of
  ever reading the real sun's position — so a planet's lit side never actually tracked where the
  sun (a fixed point at the world origin, `sun.ts`) really is. Fixed by adding a `uSunDirView`
  uniform, updated every frame per body as `normalize(-bodyWorldPos)` transformed into view space
  — cheap (one vector transform, no new lights, no shader recompilation) so it doesn't reintroduce
  the cost Stage 4 was avoiding, while making planets genuinely respond to the sun's position.
  Needs on-device re-confirmation once a deploy is possible.
- **Inconsistent name pop-in/out at different zoom distances — CONFIRMED via real on-device use
  (2026-09-03), FIXED** (Graph3D.tsx label/sector-title logic): a hub body's OWN name faded out
  at the ordinary label distance (300-540 units) while its sector title didn't switch on until
  ~2450-2750 units (MACRO_DIST's hysteresis band) — leaving a ~1900-2200-unit "dead zone" where a
  hub showed NEITHER its own name nor its sector name, regardless of how steadily the camera sat
  there. Fixed by extending a `hasSectorTitle` body's own label fade-out to meet the sector
  title's turn-on point, so the handoff is continuous (briefly overlapping, never gapped). Also
  found and fixed a second, smaller contributor: the nearest-N visible-label cap fully rebuilt its
  membership every throttle window with no stickiness, so two bodies hovering near the Nth-nearest
  boundary could swap in/out on ordinary camera drift even though the total count never changed —
  added a 15% "sticky" distance bias for already-visible bodies so a clear overtake is required
  before a name disappears. Needs on-device re-confirmation once a deploy is possible.
- **Hub names "stuck" visible while orbiting/following, and visible through the sun — CONFIRMED
  via real on-device use (2026-09-03), FIXED** (Graph3D.tsx label loop): a follow-up to the item
  above, from the same on-device report. Two distinct causes:
  1. A `hasSectorTitle` hub deliberately bypasses the top-level frustum-cull hide (so its title
     sprite, which scales up with distance, can still read on screen past the body's own small
     culling sphere) — but the SAME bypass also skipped updating that hub's own close-up label
     whenever the body rotated out of frustum, freezing it at whatever visibility/opacity it last
     had (often fully visible) instead of hiding it. Following Soumaya's ship in a sustained orbit
     around the sun swings hubs in and out of frustum continuously, so their names appeared "stuck
     on" — reproducible identically under fast manual orbiting, not specific to follow-mode itself
     (confirmed: follow-mode drives the exact same `camera.position` the tick loop already reads
     everywhere else, so there's no separate/stale camera path). Fixed by explicitly hiding a
     culled hub's own label instead of leaving its state frozen.
  2. Genuinely missing feature, not a regression: nothing ever checked whether a large opaque body
     (the sun) sits between the camera and whatever's being named, so a body directly behind the
     sun kept showing its name right through it. Added a cheap closest-point-on-segment occlusion
     test against the sun's fixed position/radius (sun.ts) — no real raycaster/BVH needed, and it
     short-circuits immediately for anything closer than the sun's own radius. Verified correct
     with a throwaway `npx tsx` script (6 geometric cases: directly behind, sun behind camera, off
     to the side, very close, clear miss, clear hit) before wiring it in, per the "prove it by
     measurement" rule — one case initially failed from a wrong-by-construction test expectation on
     my part (a symmetric camera/body layout means the ray's closest approach to the sun falls at
     the segment's midpoint, at HALF the body's offset, not the full offset), not from the actual
     occlusion logic; corrected the test and re-verified all 6 pass. The selected/followed body is
     explicitly exempt (you deliberately selected or flew to it — it must stay readable regardless
     of what's technically between the camera and it). Needs on-device re-confirmation once a
     deploy is possible.
- **Views/Lens floating in the middle of the screen — CONFIRMED via real on-device screenshots
  (2026-09-05), FIXED** (index.css `.gv-wrap`, GalaxyViews.tsx, LensChips.tsx): two screenshots
  from the same device at different sessions showed the "🌌 Views ▸" toggle and the pinned-Lens
  quick-switch chips rendered in wildly different vertical positions, sometimes floating mid-
  screen over the sun. Root cause: `.gv-wrap` was anchored `bottom: 300px` (a fixed distance from
  the bottom edge) while `.fuel-gauge`/`.streak-ember` — the button cluster it's meant to visually
  group with — are anchored `top: 50%` (viewport-vertical-center-relative). Those two anchor
  families drift apart whenever the real rendered viewport height differs between sessions (e.g.
  Android Chrome's collapsing/expanding address bar) — a concrete case of the exact "hand-
  maintained pixel-offset table" fragility already flagged elsewhere in this doc and in Phase L's
  product audit. Fixed per explicit user direction: (1) re-anchored `.gv-wrap` to
  `top: calc(50% + 100px)`, joining the SAME anchor family as `.fuel-gauge`/`.streak-ember` so it
  moves in lockstep with that cluster regardless of viewport height, instead of re-tuning another
  standalone bottom-offset constant; (2) eliminated the second independently-floating overlay
  entirely — the pinned-Lens chips (formerly their own `<LensChips>` in App.tsx) now render as an
  in-flow `.lens-list` INSIDE the Views dropdown (GalaxyViews.tsx), so there is only one floating
  element in this area, not two that can drift apart. `.gv-chips`'s `max-height` was recalculated
  from a flat `40vh` to `calc(50vh - 156px)` to prevent the now-downward-growing dropdown from
  overflowing short devices. The exact `+100px` offset is estimated from `.fuel-gauge`'s own CSS
  layout math, not pixel-measured on-device — flagged for confirmation, but the structural fix
  (shared anchor family; one floating element instead of two) is what actually closes the bug.
  Needs on-device re-confirmation once a deploy is possible.
- **Nebula backdrop "cut out" color patch — CONFIRMED via real on-device screenshot (2026-09-05),
  FIXED** (graph/backdropBake.ts `bakeBackdrop`): the baked nebula/galaxy-glow backdrop showed a
  hard-edged, wrongly-toned color patch (a geometric "cut out" shape) instead of smoothly fading
  to black. Root cause: `WebGLCubeRenderTarget`'s texture defaults to `NoColorSpace` (correct for
  a texture feeding further linear-space processing) but this one is assigned directly to
  `scene.background` for direct display — exactly like the `CanvasTexture`s in `nodeObject.ts` and
  `skybox.ts`, which both already set `colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace` for that reason. Missing
  it here meant the additively-blended, overlapping sprites baked into this texture displayed with
  the wrong color-space interpretation, most visible exactly where several sprites summed into a
  bright patch. Fixed by adding `target.texture.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;` right after
  the render target is constructed, matching the established codebase convention exactly rather
  than attempting a more speculative shader/geometry change. Needs on-device re-confirmation once
  a deploy is possible.
- **Fly billing hold, ongoing since 2026-08-29:** most of the above (and everything shipped since)
  still hasn't been visually verified on a real device via this app's own deploy pipeline. On
  2026-09-03 the owner sent real on-device screenshots of two screens (Observatory, the galaxy
  HUD) and separately described several more real, on-device behaviors while using the 3D galaxy
  (link flicker, dim planets, inconsistent name pop-in, names stuck visible/through the sun while
  orbiting) — the items above are marked CONFIRMED + FIXED from that direct feedback, but
  everything else in this section remains unconfirmed. This section stays a running list of
  "check these once a full deploy is possible," not a backlog to pause work for — keep shipping;
  keep appending here as new visual-dependent changes land, per the owner's explicit instruction
  not to stop finding/fixing things just because most of it can't currently be looked at.


- Match the surrounding code's style and comment density (comments explain *why*).
- Don't add dependencies casually — prefer small, dependency-free solutions.
- Don't break the offline fallback path.
- Don't put model identifiers or secrets in committed files.
- Accessibility (non-negotiable, pure code): honor `prefers-reduced-motion` — new galaxy/UI motion
  must calm or pause under it — and never encode meaning in colour alone (pair it with shape/size/label).
