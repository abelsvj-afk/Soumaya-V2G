/**
 * Phase M first-launch framing (docs/specs/soumaya-product-audit.md, "no explanation of what
 * Soumaya/the companion/the Galaxy are"). Shown ONCE per space (gated by the caller via
 * localStorage, same pattern as the existing one-time Legend reveal in App.tsx) — a single,
 * short, dismissible card, not a multi-step tour. Copy is deliberately literal about what each
 * part actually does — no claim of omniscience, no implication the Galaxy holds everything.
 *
 * Phase AC.1 (docs/specs/soumaya-connective-tissue-onboarding.md): the audit found this screen
 * named "goals, money, people, and journeys" only in passing inside the first bullet — a new
 * user had no way to learn Money/Wealth, Life Vision, and Journeys are real, separate places to
 * go, not just words in a sentence. Added one more bullet naming them concretely, plus a link to
 * the full Help manual (`onSeeHelp`) for anyone who wants more than this one-screen framing —
 * deliberately NOT expanded into a tour or manual itself.

            <b>Soumaya</b> is your personal Life + Financial Operating System — your memories,
            goals, money, people, and journeys, all connected in one place instead of scattered
            across separate apps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>{companionName}</b> is who you talk to. Ask her about anything you've told her —
            she reasons over what's actually in your galaxy, and says so plainly when something
            isn't in there yet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>The Galaxy</b> is the living map of it: each memory becomes a star, sized by how
            much it matters and linked to the goals, people, and money it relates to.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Money, Life Vision, and Journeys</b> are real tabs, not just words — track what you
            earn and owe, name what you're ultimately building toward, and group it all into the
            life chapters (journeys) it actually belongs to.
