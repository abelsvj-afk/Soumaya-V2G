Ideas are alive: they brighten as memories come to support them, dim and eventually fade if you never return to them, and near-duplicate ideas merge on their own. When an idea matures (enough support), a '✨ Ripe — promote to Goal' button appears so you can commit to it — turning it into a durable goal your memories orbit. Skills level up on their own: every memory that evidences practice raises the skill's level (Novice → Beginner → Practiced → Skilled → Advanced → Expert) and brightens it, so you never have to hand-crank the bar — just log what you do. Identities are held to the evidence of your life: memories that express who you are brighten an identity, while ones that contradict it (in your own words — 'I quit…', 'no longer…', 'I'm not…') dim it. Open 'Evidence' on an identity card to see what's affirming vs contesting it (▲/▼) and jump to those memories. People work like a lightweight CRM: add someone and every memory that mentions them orbits them; open 'Relationship' on a person card to see your interactions, when you last engaged, and the emotional tone (warm / heavy / mixed). Soumaya also spots names you mention a lot but haven't added and offers them as one-tap 'People you mention' chips, and quietly merges duplicate person entries. The mind also handles time and drive: a future event carries a date and shows a countdown ('in 3d', 'today', 'overdue'), then rolls into memory once it passes; an intention is a short-lived comet that either gets fulfilled (you act on it → it settles into memory) or expires if ignored; a motivation is a gravity well that brightens as more of your memories align with it; and mental models show what they're 'applied to'. A Life Vision (🌅) is the same '+' flow, one kind among the rest — but it's the one built for a whole desired chapter, not a single task: give it a target date, and open its card's 'Financial Goals' section to link the Money-tab goals funding it and see the deterministic total still needed and how much is already covered.", tags: ["mind", "cognitive", "goal", "idea", "skill", "identity", "person", "mental model", "motivation", "gravity", "progress", "direction", "promote", "fade", "merge", "lifecycle", "life vision", "vision", "target date", "financial goals", "funding"] },
