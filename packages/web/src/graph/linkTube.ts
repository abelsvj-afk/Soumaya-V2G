/**
 * Curved-link tube geometry, reused frame-to-frame instead of rebuilt.
 *
 * three-forcegraph's own per-frame link-position sync (three-forcegraph.mjs's
 * `layoutTick`) constructs a brand-new `THREE.TubeGeometry` -- with a brand-new
 * `QuadraticBezierCurve3` and several fresh `Vector3`s -- for every curved link,
 * on EVERY rendered frame, then disposes the previous geometry (see
 * docs/specs/soumaya-galaxy-*-audit.md, Round 4). This app's `linkWidth`/
 * `linkCurvature` accessors (Graph3D.tsx) are always nonzero, so every visible
 * link takes this path: an O(visible links) per-frame allocation + GPU-reupload
 * cost with zero caching, confirmed by direct source reads (both this repo and
 * the installed `three-forcegraph` package) as the dominant cause of the
 * catastrophic FPS collapse on a large/full Galaxy View.
 *
 * This module intercepts exactly that path via three-forcegraph's own
 * `linkPositionUpdate` extension point -- a documented, application-layer hook
 * (three-forcegraph.mjs's `layoutTick`: returning `true` from this callback
 * skips the library's own `calcLinkCurve()` + geometry-rebuild for that link
 * entirely). Each link's tube geometry -- matching THREE.TubeGeometry's exact
 * vertex/normal/uv/index layout, for zero visual difference -- is built ONCE
 * and cached (keyed by the link object itself, via a WeakMap so entries are
 * naturally collected once a link leaves `data.links`). Every subsequent
 * frame, only the position/normal attribute arrays are recomputed IN PLACE
 * (via the curve's own public `computeFrenetFrames()`/`getPointAt()` APIs) --
 * no new geometry, no `.dispose()`, no GPU buffer reallocation, just
 * `attribute.needsUpdate = true` (a partial upload onto the existing GPU
 * resource).
 *
 * Ownership/disposal: the geometry lives at `mesh.geometry`, the exact field
 * three-forcegraph itself reads/disposes when a link's Object3D is actually
 * removed (its own `_deallocate`/removal path disposes whatever is currently
 * assigned there) -- so no separate disposal path or cache-eviction logic is
 * needed here; three-forcegraph's existing disposal already covers it.
 *
 * CRITICAL, previously-undiscovered gap this file did NOT close (Galaxy recovery
 * pass, 2026-09-10): three-forcegraph's own object DIGEST (separate from the per-
 * frame position loop above -- this one runs inside `onUpdateObj`, driven by
 * React prop changes, not animation frames) independently gate-checks every
 * link's CURRENT `obj.geometry` on every digest pass:
 *
 *   if (!obj.geometry.type.match(/^Cylinder(Buffer)?Geometry$/) ||
 *       obj.geometry.parameters.radiusTop !== r ||
 *       obj.geometry.parameters.radialSegments !== numSegments) {
 *     obj.geometry.dispose();
 *     obj.geometry = cylinderGeometries[linkWidth];
 *   }
 *
 * This app's `linkColor` prop is a deliberately unmemoized inline closure (see
 * Graph3D.tsx's own comment on that prop) SPECIFICALLY so its identity changes on
 * every Graph3D render, re-triggering this digest to pick up live activity-driven
 * color/opacity -- but that digest has NO IDEA this module manages link geometry
 * itself. `entry.geometry` is a plain `THREE.BufferGeometry` (`.type ===
 * "BufferGeometry"`, no `.parameters`), so the FIRST check term is always true
 * (short-circuiting the `||` before `.parameters` is ever read, so no crash) --
 * meaning EVERY digest pass, for EVERY tube-rendered link, called `.dispose()` on
 * THIS EXACT geometry object (the one cached and reused above) and swapped
 * `mesh.geometry` to a shared flat cylinder. The self-healing reassignment above
 * (`mesh.geometry = entry.geometry`) then re-attaches the very geometry that was
 * JUST disposed a moment earlier -- restoring the correct REFERENCE, but three.js
 * had already removed it from `WebGLGeometries`' cache on dispose, so the next
 * render silently re-uploads the ENTIRE geometry (position + normal + uv + index
 * buffers) from scratch, every time -- exactly the "no `.dispose()`, no GPU buffer
 * reallocation, just a partial upload" guarantee this file's own header claims,
 * defeated by a code path this file never accounted for. Confirmed no core
 * three.js code branches on `Geometry.type` (it is a pure serialization/duck-
 * typing string), so `create()`/`update()` below deliberately spoof `.type` and
 * `.parameters` to make three-forcegraph's own check pass, permanently. This
 * does not touch how three-forcegraph applies COLOR/OPACITY/MATERIAL (a
 * completely separate branch in the same `onUpdateObj`, unaffected by this fix)
 * -- only the geometry-identity check this module's own reused geometry was
 * never being recognized by.
 *
 * Known, deliberately-accepted residual costs (not eliminated by this module,
 * and not new -- both already present in the current, unmodified per-frame
 * TubeGeometry construction this replaces):
 *  - `curve.computeFrenetFrames()` allocates ~3*(TUBULAR_SEGMENTS+1) fresh
 *    `Vector3`s internally every call (three.js's own implementation has no
 *    scratch-buffer parameter) -- unavoidable without hand-reimplementing
 *    Frenet-frame math, which risks subtly wrong tube twist/orientation.
 *  - `curve.getPointAt()`/`getTangentAt()` rely on an arc-length cache
 *    (`Curve.getLengths()`, default 200 divisions) that must be invalidated
 *    every frame the curve's control points change (`curve.needsUpdate =
 *    true`) -- each invalidation re-samples 200 points. THREE.TubeGeometry's
 *    own construction pays this exact same cost every time it's built, so
 *    this is not a regression, just an unremoved pre-existing cost.
 * Both are flagged in the implementation report rather than hidden.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT intercepted (falls back to three-forcegraph's own,
 * already-correct handling): zero width (a link `shouldRenderLink` has culled
 * -- rare, LOD-gated), zero curvature (never happens in this app today, but
 * safe to leave alone), and coincident endpoints (a self-loop link -- an edge
 * case this app's associative/journey/cognitive linking never produces).
 * Keeping the intercepted surface to exactly "curved, nonzero-width, distinct
 * endpoints" is what makes this a small, reviewable change instead of a
 * broader rewrite of link rendering.
 *
 * SECOND resource-lifecycle defect, confirmed by source (Galaxy render-stall
 * forensic pass, 2026-09-11) — distinct from the digest gap above, and NOT closed by
 * the `.type`/`.parameters` spoofing that fixed that one: a full `fg.refresh()` call
 * sets three-forcegraph's internal `_flushObjects` flag, which runs `data-bind-mapper`'s
 * `digest([])` against the link map — every currently-tracked link's Object3D is torn
 * down via the library's generic, UNCONDITIONAL removal path
 * (`scene.remove(obj); _deallocate(obj);`, where `_deallocate` calls
 * `obj.geometry.dispose()` regardless of `.type`/`.parameters` — that spoofing only
 * ever protected the narrower digest-gate check quoted above, not this removal path).
 * This disposes the EXACT SAME shared `entry.geometry` this cache hands out — and on
 * the very next `update()` call for that same link (same WeakMap key), the cache found
 * its entry and returned `entry.geometry` UNCHANGED, silently handing three.js a
 * geometry whose GPU resources were just freed. Three.js has no choice but to
 * transparently re-upload the entire buffer set (position/normal/uv/index) the next
 * time it's drawn — for every tracked link at once, synchronously, inside that
 * `renderer.render()` call. Population-scaling, intermittent (only when `_flushObjects`
 * fires — Soumaya's link-repair cadence, a new link, or any node selection via
 * `linkWidthCb`'s `activeId` dependency), and a strong match for the catastrophic,
 * population-correlated render stalls measured on the physical device (see
 * docs/specs/soumaya-galaxy-cache-disposal-audit.md for the identical class of bug,
 * previously confirmed and fixed for the analogous NODE cache).
 *
 * `BufferGeometry` has no `Object3D`-style parent/ownership signal to check (unlike the
 * node-cache fix's `.parent === null`), and confirmed directly against the installed
 * three.js source, `dispose()` sets no public flag on the geometry itself — it only
 * calls `this.dispatchEvent({type:'dispose'})` (`BufferGeometry extends EventDispatcher`).
 * That dispatched event IS the one reliable, three.js-driven signal available — the
 * same mechanism `WebGLRenderer`'s own internal `WebGLGeometries` uses to notice
 * disposal — so `create()` below attaches a listener that flips `entry.disposed` (a flag
 * THIS cache defines and owns, not a property invented on the geometry) the moment
 * disposal genuinely happens, from whichever caller triggered it. `update()` then checks
 * that flag before trusting a cache hit: a disposed entry is discarded and rebuilt fresh,
 * exactly mirroring the "cache miss" path that already runs correctly for a brand-new
 * link — no new code path, no behavior change for the (overwhelmingly common) case where
 * nothing was disposed.
