/**
 * Money-sky (Stage 4 Part A) — turns bills into "stars" with a STATE the galaxy renders as
 * colour/glow/glyph (cooling = blue). Deterministic, from the Budget Engine (offline). The web
 * moneySky layer draws one small star per entry; the `glyph` is the on-focus status icon.
 * See docs/financial-os/stage-4-galaxy-and-zero-based.md §A2.
 *
 * Also emits one `kind: "goal"` star per active Wealth goal (docs/specs/wealth-goals-allocation.md
 * §11) — this activates MoneyStar.kind/"goal_filling"/"goal_reached"/fillPct, which were declared
 * on the type but never produced before this. Bill logic and goal logic are two independent
 * branches that never share state; a goal's state is progress-driven (fillPct), never date-driven
 * like a bill's. Archived goals are excluded automatically — getWealthSummary()'s goal list
 * already only returns non-archived goals, the same "excluded by default" convention bills use.
