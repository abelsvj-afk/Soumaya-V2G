/**
 * Bill-risk nudge (Financial OS, docs/financial-os/architecture.md §5) — Soumaya's proactive
 * money moment. When your cushion is thin against an upcoming NON-autopay bill, she warns you
 * BEFORE an overspend makes it short, in her own voice. Deterministic + offline: the numbers
 * come from the pure Budget Engine (LLM-free); at most one nudge per space per day.
 *
 * Phase S pilot (docs/specs/soumaya-shared-communication.md): this is the one proactive
 * surface Phase R named as the clearest instance of "intelligent detection, static
 * communication" — detect() correctly finds a real financial risk, but run() used to emit one
 * of exactly two hardcoded sentences forever, regardless of anything else already known about
 * the user. The DETECTION LOGIC BELOW IS COMPLETELY UNCHANGED — same thresholds, same Budget
 * Engine, same autopay/tight-cushion math. Only the MESSAGE now consults the shared
 * CommunicationContext (soul/behavior/preferences/emotional-pattern context, all already
 * built and already used by Chat) plus one new, generic, communication-only signal
 * (`recentActionCount` — has this nudge already fired lately) to select among a still fully
 * deterministic set of phrasings, instead of a fixed pair. No LLM call was added: see
 * `docs/specs/soumaya-shared-communication.md` §Performance for why a template remains the
 * right choice for this pilot.

/**
 * Deterministic message selection informed by CommunicationContext. Kept OUTSIDE the shared
 * context module on purpose — a different proactive surface (a future Journey-update nudge,
 * say) would derive different branching from the SAME context shape, so this domain-specific
 * decision belongs with the tool that owns the message, not baked into the reusable boundary.
 *
 * Priority, most to least specific (never a combinatorial cross-product of every flag —
 * Phase S's own explicit warning against "configuration hell"):
 *  1. `preferConcise` wins outright — the shortest possible form, no elaboration, regardless
 *     of anything else (an explicit, evidence-gated learned preference is the strongest signal
 *     this function has).
 *  2. Otherwise, the OPENING clause is chosen by (in order) repetition-awareness, then
 *     emotional-context gentleness, then the original default opener — softening tone, never
 *     inventing or naming an emotion (Phase S §12: never turn a detected pattern into a claim
 *     about how the user feels).
 *  3. `preferDirect` drops the softening closer clause in favor of a plain, shorter ask.
