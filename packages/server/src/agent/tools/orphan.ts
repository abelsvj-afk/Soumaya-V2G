/**
 * Orphan-star surfacing (NEURO_ALIGNMENT.md #4). An unlinked memory is a star adrift —
 * the report says surface them so the user can integrate them. Gently: at most ONE
 * orphan nudged per space per day (guarded by today's own agent_logs entry, so no new
 * column), choosing the most significant long-drifting orphan. Deterministic + offline.
 *
 * Phase U (docs/specs/soumaya-proactive-communication-migration-wave2.md) — detect()'s
 * selection query below is COMPLETELY UNCHANGED (same `ORDER BY importance DESC,
 * created_at ASC` ranking). `importance` was already computed to CHOOSE the orphan but
 * discarded before the message was built; `run()`'s own re-fetch (needed anyway to
 * re-confirm it's still unlinked) now also reads `importance`/`created_at` — the exact
 * same columns the SAME row already has, not a new query or a second detector — so the
 * message can reflect how long it's drifted and whether it seemed to matter. Adds the
 * shared CommunicationContext's verbosity preference and a repetition signal (has an
 * orphan nudge fired recently). Zero new LLM calls; when none of that evidence applies,
 * the wording is byte-identical to the pre-Phase-U default.
