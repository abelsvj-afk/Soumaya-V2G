 * conversation candidate, not just a smarter notification. Reuses the exact existing
 * `goalAllocationChange()` intelligence (Phase W's audited recommendation) — this file
 * adds ZERO new financial calculation, zero new trend algorithm. It only decides WHEN
 * that already-computed, already-honest signal (it refuses to fabricate a trend from
 * thin history — `status: "insufficient_history"`) is meaningful and fresh enough to
 * surface, then hands it to the exact same CommunicationContext/delivery pipeline
 * every other tool-router pilot already uses.
 *
 * Two-consecutive-period evidence (Phase X §2): `goalAllocationChange()` is called
 * TWICE — once at `now` and once at `now` shifted back by one full allocation window —
 * reusing the SAME function to read the prior period's own trend, not a new comparison.
 * Both calls must be `status: "compared"` (never "insufficient_history") with the SAME
 * direction before this tool considers a goal eligible.
