/**
 * Review-nudge (NEURO_ALIGNMENT.md #1) — the active-recall arm of spaced repetition.
 * When a memory's strength has decayed to its review point, Soumaya asks you to RECALL
 * it in her own voice (retrieval practice beats re-reading). Gentle: at most one nudge
 * per space per day, most significant + weakest first. Grading happens via /api/review.
 *
 * Phase U (docs/specs/soumaya-proactive-communication-migration-wave2.md) — detect()'s
 * ranking (via `dueForReview()`) is COMPLETELY UNCHANGED. `run()`'s row re-fetch (already
 * needed to get the label) now also reads `importance`/`review_count`/the columns
 * `memoryStrength()` needs — the SAME already-scheduled row, not a new detector — so the
 * message can explain WHY this particular recall is worth asking for: a genuinely faded
 * memory, one never reviewed before, or one that clearly matters. This is a MORE precise
 * repetition signal than a generic "have we nudged recently" read, since it's specific to
 * THIS memory (a fresh memory's first-ever nudge reads differently from one that keeps
 * coming back) — so this tool deliberately does not also call `recentActionCount`.

/**
 * A single reason clause, chosen by priority (most meaningful first), appended to a
 * stable template — compositional, not a hand-written sentence per combination. When
 * none of the three conditions hold, this returns the exact original sentence.
