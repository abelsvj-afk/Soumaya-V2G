/**
 * Proactive check-ins (SOUMAYA_TOOLS.md tool #3). Beyond the once-a-day digest, she
 * reaches out WHEN something happens — a heavy emotional stretch, or two memories that
 * pull against each other (an unaddressed contradiction). Gentle + rate-limited: at
 * most one check-in per space per day. Deterministic + offline.
 *
 * Phase T pilot (docs/specs/soumaya-proactive-communication-migration.md) — the
 * non-financial consumer proving `communication/context.ts` generalizes beyond
 * billRisk (Phase S). detect()'s own heaviness/contradiction detection below is
 * COMPLETELY UNCHANGED — this tool already performs its own emotional read (a raw
 * 5-day mean-of-emotional_weight check, deliberately separate from
 * `analysis/emotional.ts`'s pattern detector — a pre-existing signal that predates this
 * phase and is left exactly as-is, per the phase's "preserve existing intelligence" rule).
 * Because detect() already IS this surface's emotional signal, `run()` deliberately does
 * NOT also read `CommunicationContext.emotionalPatterns` — doing so would mean two
 * independent emotional reads feeding one message, which is redundant, not more
 * intelligent (the "available vs. relevant" distinction this phase asks to preserve).
 * Only `preferences` (learned verbosity/directness) and a repetition-awareness read
 * (`recentActionCount` — has check-in already fired recently) shape HOW the
 * already-detected signal is phrased. Zero new LLM calls; every default (no-evidence)
 * branch below is byte-identical to the pre-Phase-T wording.
