/**
 * Shared Soumaya Communication boundary (Phase S,
 * docs/specs/soumaya-shared-communication.md). Phase R found that Chat already assembles a
 * real communication-strategy layer (soul/identity, derived behavior, learned interaction
 * preferences, bounded emotional context) but every proactive surface is disconnected from
 * all of it. This module is that layer's SHARED READ — not a new intelligence system, not a
 * new source of truth, not a competing preference/personality store. Every field here is
 * produced by an already-existing, already-locked function; this module only bundles their
 * outputs behind one reusable, read-only, space-scoped call.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT: a giant "everything about the user" dump. It carries exactly the four
 * inputs Chat's own prompt assembly (`chat/graphrag.ts`) already treats as communication
 * inputs (as opposed to fact/content inputs) — nothing about Journeys, Money, Wealth, People,
 * or memory content lives here. A caller that needs THOSE still goes to the same
 * *SnapshotText functions/repos Chat already uses for facts; this module is deliberately
 * narrower than that.
 *
 * Zero LLM calls. Every field is either a cheap deterministic SQL read/aggregate (already
 * proven cheap — `refreshPersona`/`deriveBehavior`/`interactionPreferenceSnapshotText` are all
 * already called on every chat turn) or, for `emotionalPatterns`, a bounded read the caller
 * explicitly opts into (see `CommunicationContextOptions` below) — this function never
 * silently pays for a full-space scan.
