/**

 * valuable question she could ask about your brain (interview instinct, but
 * proactive) plus her best recent discovery, and leads the arrival screen with
 * them. Answering IS logging: the reply is ingested, linked to the memory she
 * asked about, and pays the normal earn path — so the daily ritual literally
 * makes the brain smarter.
 *
 * Fully deterministic + offline-safe: the question ladder reads graph state, no
 * LLM call is needed to ASK (the cloud mind only gets involved when the answer
 * is ingested like any other memory).
