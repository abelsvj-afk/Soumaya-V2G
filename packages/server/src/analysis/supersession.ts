/**
 * Direction-of-currency resolver (docs/specs/maya-longitudinal-intelligence.md, Phase A). The
 * `maya-longitudinal-intelligence.md` audit found `EpistemicStatus` already includes
 * `"outdated"` and `"contradicted"` (added in the I1–I3 pass) but that NOTHING in the codebase
 * actually produces them — `analysis/intelligence.ts`'s `openContradictionClaims()` always
 * returns `"observation"`. This module is the smallest deterministic mechanism that closes that
 * gap: given two memories already known to be related by an EXISTING detector, decide which
 * side is temporally current, using only already-stored timestamps. Pure arithmetic — no LLM
 * call, no new persistence — and it NEVER touches either memory's actual content; it only
 * produces a transient, computed label a caller may attach to a fresh `IntelligenceClaim`.
 *
 * `"outdated"` and `"contradicted"` are NOT interchangeable outputs of the same situation —
 * they answer two different questions, so the caller must say which one it's asking:
 *  - A same-theme EVOLUTION pair (`analysis/temporalChains.ts`'s `buildEvolutionLinks*`) is a
 *    legitimate change over time ("I drive a Ford" → "I drive a Chevy") — the earlier side
 *    becomes `"outdated"`, never `"contradicted"`, because nothing here ever asserted the two
 *    statements were incompatible, only that one is older.
 *  - A genuine CONTRADICTION pair (`synthesis/contradictions.ts`'s LLM-verified conflicts,
 *    reframed by `openContradictionClaims()`) has ALREADY been judged mutually exclusive by an
 *    upstream detector — once we know which side came first, the earlier one becomes
 *    `"contradicted"`, a stronger claim than mere staleness.
