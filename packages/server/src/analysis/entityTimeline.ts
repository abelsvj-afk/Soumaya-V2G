 * new persistence layer (Section 6 already ruled that out). Built entirely from data this
 * codebase already writes: `linkCognitiveAnchor`'s `"supports"` edges, `synthesis/
 * contradictions.ts`'s `insights` rows, `analysis/temporalChains.ts`'s evolution links,
 * `analysis/clarificationResolution.ts`'s `"resolves"` edges, and Phase B's
 * `resolveSupersession`. No new table, no new relationship type, no per-entity-kind business
 * logic — the exact same function reconstructs a vehicle's, a job's, a goal's, or a person's
 * history, because it only ever asks "what's linked to this anchor" and "in what order did it
 * happen," both already-general questions.

 * Reconstruct an anchor entity's history as an ordered timeline of state-relevant events.

 * `anchor` MUST be server-resolved and space-scoped — never an LLM-supplied id, same trust
 * boundary Chat → Galaxy Navigation and Phase B's evidence already enforce. Deliberately scoped
 * to `{ domain: "memory", kind: "node" }` refs: every evidence mechanism this function reuses
 * (`"supports"`/`"resolves"` edges, contradiction insights, evolution links) is keyed on
 * `nodes` ids — extending this to money/journey anchors would need those domains' own
 * before/after relationship data, which doesn't exist yet (flagged, not built, per the brief's
 * "adapt to the real repository" instruction rather than force-fitting the sketch's generic
 * `ProvenanceRef` to domains with no timeline evidence behind them). A non-memory or
 * nonexistent/out-of-space anchor returns `[]` — the same "insufficient evidence → silence"
 * discipline this module's dependencies already use, never a thrown error for an ordinary
 * "nothing to reconstruct" case.
 *
 * Status assignment (never promotes anything to `"confirmed"` except via an ACTUAL clarification
 * resolution, never invents a status beyond these four):
 *  - `"fact"` — the default for any node's own text (`EpistemicStatus`'s own doc: "a memory's
 *    own text" is a `"fact"`-eligible source).
 *  - `"confirmed"` — the node is the SOURCE of a `"resolves"` edge, which only
 *    `analysis/clarificationResolution.ts` ever creates — i.e. this exact memory is the real
 *    knowledge node a user's clarification answer produced.
 *  - `"outdated"` / `"contradicted"` — Phase B's `resolveSupersession`, called for every
 *    contradiction-insight pair and evolution-link pair touching the working set; applied to
 *    whichever side it names `superseded`. Reuses Phase B verbatim — no second supersession
 *    algorithm, no expanded contradiction semantics.
 *
 * The older side of a resolved pair is NEVER rewritten or removed — it keeps its own event, just
 * with a stronger status label. When `resolveSupersession` can't confidently establish direction
 * (insufficient evidence), the pair is silently skipped and both sides keep their baseline
 * status — never promoted, never guessed.
