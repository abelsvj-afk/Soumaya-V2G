/**
 * Proactive → Chat context handoff (Phase Y, docs/specs/soumaya-proactive-chat-handoff.md;
 * Phase Z, docs/specs/soumaya-bill-risk-proactive-source.md). When the user opens Chat from
 * a proactive toast (Phase X's `goal_trend` pilot, Phase Z's `bill_risk` pilot), Chat must
 * know WHY the conversation exists without the user re-explaining it, and without a second
 * copy of the intelligence that triggered it.
 *
 * This module deliberately does NOT recompute a different trigger algorithm for either
 * source — `goal_trend` calls the SAME `goalAllocationChange()` Phase X's `detect()` uses;
 * `bill_risk` calls the SAME `getBudgetSummary()` bill_risk's own `detect()` uses — fresh, at
 * the moment Chat asks (exactly like `analysis/causal.ts` already re-derives
 * `incomeChange`/`netWorthChange`/`goalAllocationChange` fresh on every chat turn — the SAME
 * established pattern, not a new one). If the target no longer exists (wrong space, deleted,
 * or a stale/forged id) or the underlying evidence no longer holds, this returns `null` —
 * Chat proceeds completely normally with no proactive framing, never a broken turn.
 *
 * `proactiveContextSnapshotText()` itself remains ephemeral by construction: nothing in it is
 * ever written to `nodes`, `agent_logs`, or any other table — it's a pure read, computed fresh
 * per call, never persisted. (Phase AB's `recordProactiveDiscussion()`, below, is the one
 * deliberate exception — see its own doc comment.)
 *
 * Phase Z confirms `{source, targetId}` generalizes cleanly: both sources reduce to "a
 * space-scoped integer id on a table with its own `get(id)` repo method." Only the dispatch
 * below and the route's zod literal needed to grow — no new payload shape, no framework.
 *
 * Phase AB (docs/specs/soumaya-proactive-discussion-occurrence.md) adds exactly one durable
 * fact on top of all this: `recordProactiveDiscussion()` writes a single `agent_logs` row —
 * `action = 'chat:proactive_discussion'`, `targets = [targetId]` — the moment a REAL,
 * successfully-answered `/api/chat` exchange carried a validated proactive context. This is
 * NOT a transcript, NOT a summary, and NOT proof of anything beyond "this exchange happened
 * for this entity at this time." It is entirely separate from, and never interferes with, the
 * proactive tools' own `tool:goal_trend`/`tool:bill_risk` firing/dedup rows.

/**
 * Phase AB — the durable discussion-occurrence primitive
 * (docs/specs/soumaya-proactive-discussion-occurrence.md). Closes the gap the Phase AA audit
 * identified: `{source, targetId}` explains WHY a Chat turn was opened, but until now that
 * fact vanished the instant the response was sent — nothing recorded that the exchange ever
 * happened. This function is the one deliberate exception to this module's ephemeral design.
 *
 * Call this ONLY after `chat()` has already returned a real answer for this turn — i.e. from
 * `api/routes/chat.ts`, once `await chat(...)` has resolved without throwing, never from
 * inside `chat/graphrag.ts` itself. `chat()`'s final `deps.llm.answer(...)` call is NOT
 * wrapped in a try/catch — a provider failure there throws out of `chat()` and the route never
 * reaches `res.json()` — so recording any earlier (e.g. inside `proactiveContextSnapshotText`,
 * which runs BEFORE that call) would risk a false "discussion occurred" record for a turn that
 * actually failed. Calling this after `chat()` succeeds is the smallest defensible definition
 * of "a real proactive-context Chat interaction occurred."
 *
 * Reuses the EXACT SAME validation `proactiveContextSnapshotText()` already performs (space
 * scoping via each source's own repo `.get()`, the same "does the signal still hold" check) —
 * not a second resolution path. An invalid/stale/cross-space/unknown-source context therefore
 * produces the same `null` outcome here as it does for the chat framing itself, and no
 * `agent_logs` row is written — never a false record.
 *
 * Stores ONLY `{space_id, action: 'chat:proactive_discussion', targets: [targetId], created_at}`
 * — the source name in `description` for a human skimming `agent_logs`, nothing else. No bill
 * name, no amount, no message text, no LLM answer, no transcript. This proves exactly one
 * thing — "a real, successfully-answered proactive-context exchange happened for this entity
 * at this time" — and nothing more: not that the user agreed, took action, resolved the issue,
 * or even read the reply. It is entirely separate from the originating `tool:goal_trend`/
 * `tool:bill_risk` row (a different `action` string, read by no existing dedup query — see the
 * repo-wide `agent_logs` action inventory in the Phase AB spec) and must never be confused with
 * or substituted for it.
 *
 * Best-effort by design: any failure here (including a failure inside the reused validation)
 * is swallowed — an observational record must never turn an otherwise-successful chat reply
 * into a broken response.
