/**
 * The "Celestial Economy": Fuel is a free, in-app energy that powers Soumaya's
 * autonomous work. You EARN it by tending the galaxy (adding memories, forging
 * links, clearing action items) and she SPENDS it on autonomous LLM jobs — on
 * top of the real USD budget, which remains the hard cap. At zero fuel she idles
 * on free upkeep only. Fully space-scoped (each brain has its own fuel).
 */
/**
 * The numbers now live in `@brain/shared` so the web app can label a cost/reward
 * (e.g. "up to 2 ⛽", the Agenda's "+fuel" tooltip) without restating them as
 * literals that silently go stale when these are retuned. Re-exported here so every
 * existing server import site keeps working unchanged.
 *
 * Meanings, for reference: FUEL_CAP is a roomy tank so earnings can be banked rather
 * than hitting the ceiling. EARN_MEMORY is the main income and should feel rewarding.
 * FUEL_REGEN_PER_HOUR is a slow passive trickle (≈2.5 days empty→full) so Soumaya keeps
 * working even for an idle brain — at 6/hr regen alone overfilled the tank in under a
 * day and earning stopped meaning anything; the real USD budget is still the hard cap.
