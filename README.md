# Soumaya Second Brain

An AI-powered **3D knowledge-graph "second brain"**. Dump unstructured thoughts;
the system extracts typed entities + relationships with an LLM, embeds each
thought, stores both in an embedded SQLite database, auto-discovers associative
links to older memories (cosine KNN + LLM validation), and renders the whole
memory as an explorable, glowing 3D "galaxy".

## Monorepo layout

```
packages/
  shared/   Shared TS types + Zod schemas (the FE/BE/LLM contract)
  server/   Node 22 + better-sqlite3 + sqlite-vec data layer & (later) API
  web/      React + react-force-graph-3d galaxy UI (later phase)
```

## Stack

- **DB**: better-sqlite3 + [sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec)
  (`vec0` virtual table, cosine distance). Relational tables via Drizzle; all raw
  vector + recursive-CTE SQL isolated in `packages/server/src/db/vec.ts` and
  `graph/traversal.ts` (keeps a libsql/ANN migration path open).
- **Embeddings**: `@huggingface/transformers` (gte/MiniLM), server-side, local.
- **LLM**: `@google/genai` (Gemini) for structured extraction, behind an adapter.
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + `react-force-graph-3d` (Three.js + d3-force-3d).

## Develop

```bash
npm install          # install all workspaces
npm test             # run the test suite (server data layer + API)
npm run typecheck    # typecheck all workspaces
npm run seed         # seed a sample graph into ./brain.db

# Run the app (two terminals):
npm run dev:server   # API on http://localhost:3001
npm run dev:web      # galaxy UI on http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api)
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add `GEMINI_API_KEY` to enable LLM extraction.
Everything — ingest, embeddings, the API, and the 3D galaxy — runs **without any
API key** (a heuristic provider stands in for the LLM until a key is set).

## Deploy (Fly.io)

Single container: the Express server serves the API and the built web app; SQLite
lives on a persistent volume; the embedding model is baked into the image.

```bash
fly launch --no-deploy --copy-config   # or set `app` in fly.toml to your app name
fly volumes create brain_data --size 1 --region iad
fly secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY=...      # optional; omit to run in heuristic mode
fly deploy
```

`fly.toml` + `Dockerfile` are at the repo root. The build downloads the MiniLM
model into the image (`warm.ts`), so the container starts fast and works offline.

### Auto-deploy

Fly's GitHub integration builds the `Dockerfile` and deploys on every push to the
deploy branch — no terminal or `flyctl` needed (committing from the phone/web is
enough). See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full flow, the "Suspended"
recovery tap, and how to add a GitHub Actions CI check later. (The old
`fly-deploy.yml` workflow was removed: this account's Actions runners don't
provision, so it only produced red noise and never deployed anything.)

## Status

- [x] **Phase I** — data foundation: schema, sqlite-vec KNN, recursive-CTE
      multi-hop traversal, tests.
- [x] **Phase II** — AI pipeline: local embeddings, Gemini/OpenAI/heuristic LLM
      adapters, ingestion + associative linking.
- [x] **Phase III** — REST API + bounded/lazy graph service.
- [x] **Phase IV** — celestial 3D galaxy UI: custom node bodies, sprite labels,
      starfield, UnrealBloom, directional particles, hover-highlight, fly-to.
- [x] **Phase V** — signature features: synthesis digest (latent connections) +
      chat-with-your-brain (GraphRAG with camera-fly-to citations).

**V1 complete.** Next (V2 backlog): time-travel growth scrubber, voice capture.
